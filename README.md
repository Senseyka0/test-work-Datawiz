# Books Library

## DEMO: https://test-work-datawiz.herokuapp.com/
 
The task is to write a simple webpage in React​ that shows a list of books - data is provided via an Ajax Request, that returns a JSON object.
Note: not a real server is needed here, the ajax calls will return JSON files. However, you will need to use http-server work to return the JSON.
Each book will have:
1. Author
2. Date
3. Title

When you enter the page, an AJAX request should fetch a list of books from a json file.

The page will show all the books resolved from the requests with a proper design – nice design – high score.

The design should be based on bootstrap (http://getbootstrap.com/) or react material design (https://material-ui.com/)  include images and should look good​.

Each book can be editable, meaning that an edit button​ should be available to edit the book fields.

Edit button should open a modal with save and cancel buttons (The modal should be based on Boostrap/material ui)

Proper validation should be included for strings – not empty​, and date – should be validated​ with error message.

There should be an option to delete book with a prompt message.

Show each book title : in the following format : first letter of each word upper cased and each other letter should be lower cased, also remove any non-English letters from the title. For example : A title with the name “@@THIS is a BooK!!” should be changed to “This Is A Book”
(similar as angular filter / pipe​ )

Should have a button to add new book​.

None of this operations should be persistent (refreshing the page will clear the changes).
 Please make it readable as possible, valid html and JavaScript files.
